# Telecom Renewals Agentic POC (modular, ASCII-safe)

This repository contains a POC for telecom customer renewals built with Python and LangChain.
It parses unstructured contracts, ingests CSV-based facts (outages, usage, issues, products),
computes line right-sizing, SLA refund, and cross/upsell offers, and drafts an executive summary.
